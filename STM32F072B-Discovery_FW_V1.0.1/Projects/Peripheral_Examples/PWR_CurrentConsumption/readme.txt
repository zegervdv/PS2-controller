@par PWR_CurrentConsumption Description 

This example shows how to configure the STM32F0xx system to measure different
Low Power modes current consumption. The Low Power modes are:
  - Sleep Mode
  - STOP mode with RTC
  - STANDBY mode without RTC 
  - STANDBY mode with RTC

To run this example, user has to follow the following steps:
 1. Select the Low power modes to be measured by uncommenting the corresponding
    line inside the stm32f0xx_lp_modes.h file.
    @code
       /*#define SLEEP_MODE*/
       /*#define STOP_MODE*/
       /*#define STANDBY_MODE*/
       #define STANDBY_RTC_MODE
    @endcode       

 2. Use an external amperemeter to measure the IDD current. 

 3. This example can not be used in DEBUG mode as the JTAG IOs are disabled to
    reduce power consumption.

Here below a detailed description of the example code:

 1. After reset, the program waits for user push-button connected to the PA.00  
    to be pressed to enter the selected low power mode.
     - In SLEEP_MODE, press again the user push-button to exit the low power mode.
     - In STOP_MODE and STANDBY_RTC_MODE, the wakeup from low power mode is automatically 
       generated by the RTC (after ~5s).
     - In STANDBY_MODE test, press again user push-button to exit the low power mode.
     
 2. Low power modes description:

    - Sleep Mode
    ============  
            - System Running at PLL (48MHz)
            - Flash 1 wait state
            - Code running from Internal FLASH
            - All peripherals disabled.
            - Wakeup using EXTI Line 8 (PA.00, connected to user push-button on STM32072B-DISCO)

    - STOP Mode
    ===========
            - RTC Clocked by LSI
            - Regulator in LP mode
            - HSI, HSE OFF and LSI if not used as RTC Clock source
            - No IWDG
            - FLASH in deep power down mode
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC clocked by LSI 

    - STANDBY Mode
    ==============
            - RTC OFF
            - IWDG and LSI OFF
            - Wakeup using WakeUp Pin (PA.00, connected to user push-button on STM32072B-DISCO)
                        
    - STANDBY Mode with RTC clocked by LSI 
    ==========================================
            - RTC Clocked by LSI
            - IWDG OFF
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F072xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F072B-DISCO RevB 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32F072B-DISCO Set-up
    - Use LED4 connected  to PC.08 pin.
    - Use User button connected to PA.00 pin.
    - Connect an amperemeter to JP2 to measure the IDD current

@par How to use it ?
